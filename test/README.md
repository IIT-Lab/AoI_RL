Trained RL model needs to be saved in `test/models/`. 

To test a trained model for the proposed solution, run 
```
python proposed.py
```
To test baseline 1, run
```
python base1.py
```
To test baseline 2, run
```
python base2.py
```

Results will be saved in `test/results/`. 

To view the results, run
